        <h2>How CSGO Cases Work</h2>
        <p>
            The game, Counter Strike Global Offensive, or CSGO for short, is a tactical first 
            person shooter that revolves around two teams, counter-terrorists and terrorists. 
            The main goal of the terrorists is to plant a bomb on one of two bomb sites that 
            are on each map. The goal of the counter-terrorists is to stop the terrorist from 
            blowing up one of the bomb sites before the in-game timer hits zero. This is a 
            competitive game that requires quick thinking and perfect planning to stop the 
            opposing team from carrying out their objective.
        </p>
        <p>
            In CSGO, there are a variety of weapons/guns that have different skins. Skins 
            can consist of differnt patterns and colors or pictures that will show up on the 
            weapons if applied. To obtain weapon skins, the user will have to use real world money 
            to purchase cases and keys from the in-game market. Cases can typically cost between 
            $0.50 to $3.00 but some cases have hit prices upwards of $400. Keys on the other hand 
            will always cost $2.49 and are needed to open cases. There are some cases that do 
            not require keys but they are typically more expensive becasue of this.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weapon skins that are aquired from these cases can range from a simple pattern 
            and color to a very complex pattern or image. The skins that are seen as more simple 
            are more common to obtain when opening cases as opposed to complex skins. Typically 
            when opening a case, the user will obtain a skin that costs less than the case and 
            key combined. However, rarer skins will cost significantly more money than the case 
            and key. The prices of skins are directly influenced by the skins rarity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly cases can contain a 'rare item' that consists of either a knife or pair of 
            gloves. Knives and gloves are typically the most expensive item the user can 
            obtain from cases but becuase of their expensive price tag they are quite rare with 
            about a 0.26% chance. Not only is it rare to get a knife or gloves, these items also 
            have their own skins that make them more rare and sought after. This ultimately makes 
            these items even more expensive than their stock counter parts.

            This website was created as a simple cases opening website and does not require 
            any form of money to participate. This website uses the 
            <a class="csgoapishoutout" style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://bymykel.github.io/CSGO-API/">CSGO API</a> to create a mock case 
            opening experience.
